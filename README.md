# web-scraping-challenge - Tyler Hill

## Instructions 

The purpose of this repository is to build a Python-Flask app to scrape Mars information from the web and store the results in a MongoDB database. The results are then displayed in an HTML/CSS webpage.

The app required two methods:

1. Scraping 

2. MongoDB and Flask Application

## Part 1: Scraping

The initial scraping is performed using a Python-based app developed using Jupyter Notebook and making use of Python dependencies including BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.

## Part 2: MongoDB and Flask Application

The data scraped from the web is then inserted into a MongoDB database and the results are displayed using Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all the information that was scraped from web.
